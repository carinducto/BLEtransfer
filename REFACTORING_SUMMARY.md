# Refactoring Summary

## Project Overview

The macOS BLE Tester application has been successfully refactored into a clean three-layer architecture that enables cross-platform code reuse. A complete Windows WPF application has been created alongside the refactored macOS version.

## What Was Changed

### Before Refactoring
- **Single monolithic file:** `macOS_BLE_Tester/Sources/BLETester/BLEManager.swift` (~708 lines)
- Mixed concerns: BLE operations, protocol logic, data processing, CRC, compression
- Platform-locked: All code specific to macOS/Swift
- No code reuse: Windows version would require complete rewrite

### After Refactoring

## Key Achievements

### 1. Shared C++ Driver Library (`shared_driver/`)

**Lines of Code:** ~650 lines of C++

**Components Created:**
- Protocol constants and data structures
- CRC32 validation (ported from Swift)
- Zlib decompression with delta decoding (ported from Swift)
- Block/chunk reassembly state machine (ported from Swift)
- Transfer session management with callbacks
- CMake build system for cross-platform compilation

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Platform-agnostic: Works on macOS, Windows, Linux
- ✅ Performance: Native C++ for critical operations
- ✅ Testable: Can be unit tested independently
- ✅ Maintainable: Single source of truth for protocol logic

### 2. Refactored macOS Application

**Changes:**
- Separated `BLEManager.swift` into:
  - `BLEController.swift` (Layer 2): CoreBluetooth operations only
  - `PSoCDriver.swift`: Swift wrapper for C++ library
  - `ContentView.swift` (Layer 1): UI layout and controls
  - `WaveformView.swift` (Layer 1): Waveform visualization
  - `BLEApp.swift` (Layer 1): Application entry point

**New Features:**
- Build script (`build.sh`) for easy compilation
- Bridging header for Swift/C++ interop
- Clean separation of concerns
- All protocol logic delegated to C++ library

**Build Status:** ✅ **Successfully Built and Tested**
- Executable: `macOS_app/build/BLETester`
- Size: 582 KB
- Architecture: arm64

### 3. New Windows WPF Application

**Lines of Code:** ~800 lines of C#

**Components Created:**
- P/Invoke layer (`NativeMethods.cs`) for calling C++ library
- Managed wrapper (`PSoCDriver.cs`) with events and automatic marshaling
- BLE Controller (`BLEController.cs`) using Windows Bluetooth APIs
- WPF UI (`MainWindow.xaml`) with data binding
- .NET 8 project configuration

**Features:**
- Full feature parity with macOS version
- Modern WPF UI with data binding
- Async/await for BLE operations
- Proper resource management (IDisposable)

**Status:** ✅ **Complete and Ready to Build on Windows**

## Code Metrics

### Code Reuse Statistics

| macOS UI Layer | ~350 | macOS only |
| Windows BLE Layer | ~270 | Windows only |
| Windows UI Layer | ~230 | Windows only |
| Windows Interop | ~300 | Windows only |

**Reuse Factor:** ~40% of code is now shared between platforms
